    "# Predicting Soccer Matches\n",
    "\n",
    "- To predict soccer matches seems like a very interesting problem on which to apply ML.  Soccer clubs, bettors, and others with a stake in the results are likewise looking to do so to gain an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure\n",
    "- The benchmarks will be \n",
    "    - ~50%, the accuracy rate at which most news outlets and pundits average\n",
    "    - ~60%, an average of betting sites which use proprietary algorithms and methods\n",
    "    - ~70%, the accuracy rate one would achieve if betting with the market\n",
    "- As a baseline, a null hypothesis is created that a team will beat another if they are higher in the FIFA/Elo rankings\n",
    "- Predictions will be of 'Team 1 Win', 'Team 2 Win', or 'Draw' between two sides, which makes this a classification problem\n",
    "    - I hope to successfully apply and obtain serviceable results with Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machines, and if time allows, a Dense Neural Network with a softmax output layer.\n",
    "    - As 'Draws' are an important and meaningful result, I exclude Logistic Regression as I believe binary classification would not accurately capture important results\n",
    "    - I exclude Naive Bayes because the assumption of independence does not reflect trends / 'streaks' of winning that may occur due to a variety of factors such as emotion, player fitness, etc."
